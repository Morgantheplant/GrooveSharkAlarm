GrooveSharkAlarm
================

Sets an alarm that plays a song on GrooveShark

A friend gave me this challenge to add an alarm feature to Grooveshark using only Javascript. 

Copy and paste this code into the console when you are at http://grooveshark.com


-Add a song to the playlist w/o playing it
-input the desired time and the click "Set Alarm"

**Warning I built this in a large browser window an didnt take into account windows smaller than 1500px**
